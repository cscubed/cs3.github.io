        <h1>Pub Crawl T-Shirt Order Form Closed</h1>
        <p>
            Pub Crawl tshirt pre-orders have now closed. We ordered a few extra shirts and
            will be selling them for $30 cash on a first come first served basis on
            the day of pubcrawl starting at 3.45pm in S Block basement.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you already ordered a shirt and haven't yet paid, please deposit $15.00 into the CS3 bank account (06-0301-0251559-00).
            You will be able to collect your shirt on the day!
            If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email us: contact@cs3.org.nz
