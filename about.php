				<h3 class="subhead">About Us</h3>
				The Computer Science Student Society (more commonly referred to as CSÂ³) are a
				bunch of students who are passionate about making computer science at
				The University of Waikato a better place by running fun events and connecting
				students with upcoming opportunities (e.g. networking, job interviews etc.)
				<br><br>
				Our regular items include social BBQs, LAN parties, promoting lectures and
				events on campus (think Google Workshops), advertising job opportunities,
				running tutorials to prepare students for industry and pushing information
				such as cool developments in the industry. We also run two one off events per
				year, first a fundraising Pub Quiz for a good cause supported by our member
				base and at the end of the year we have our annual Computer Science Pub Crawl
				to celebrate another year gone!
